For the TA:

The folder is:              cmpt218-assignment04
The command to start is:    npm run csil

"npm run csil" uses p2m, but p2m wasn't working every time so there is a fallback "npm run csil-node" which uses node instead of p2m.

Also the login wasn't working in Chrome and I figured some Chrome extensions were conflicting with the session. 
So if you have the same problem run it in incognito mode or a different browser.
